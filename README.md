# XDQN (Extended DQN)XDQN is a combination of successful algorithms inspired by [Rainbow DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf).It's designed to run well on not super powerful computers (unlike [Ape-X](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00933.pdf)).It also uses Rust to alleviate performance sensitive parts of the algorithm (eg. the priority sum tree).XDQN is based on the following algorithms:* [DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)* [Multi-Step](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00115009.pdf)* [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)* [Dueling Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)* [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)* [Quantile Regression DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10044)XDQN also draws inspiration from [R2D2](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1lyTjAqYX), a distributed algorithm.XDQN has been tested on my computer:* Debian 10 (buster)* AMD Ryzen 5 1600* Nvidia GeForce 1060 6gb* 16gb of RAM
